# Wizard Frontend
​
This is the frontend component of the Wizard application. This was originally a fork of the [Cytomine Web UI](https://github.com/cytomine/Cytomine-Web-UI), but has since seen the addition of the ability to analyze project images.
​
## Getting started
​
### Prerequisites
​
In order to build this application you only need NPM installed.
​
### Installing
​
First ```npm i```

After install all node modules simply run:

```npm run serve```

to start a local webserver.
​
## Deployment
​
Currently deployment is done manually, but you can still build a production locally using:

```npm run build```
​
## Contributing
​
​To contribute you need an understanding if these JS frameworks:

- Vue.js (with its additions such as Vuex and Vue-router)
- Openlayers

We currently use the included ESLint linter which can be run using:

```npm run lint```
